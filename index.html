This week was kind of an interesting week. I used tinkercad again 
afterabout 3 years. It took a little time to get used to but 
eventually I got the hang of it. I wasn't here for one day of the 
week so I was confused for one day.

This past week we have been learning how to use bread boards. 
We use the breadboards to power things like LED's. There is a
lot of math involved when using breaboards so that you can 
calculate the exact right amount of Current,Resistance and Voltage.
Working on breadboards can be fun but can also be stressing.

 This week we took everything we knew about breadboards and used it
 in real life. We took our breadboarding skills and we 
 powered 3 LED's using our bread board. It was a a success, me and 
 my partner did it first try.

This week Mr.Poole had made a slide show to teach our class all 
about civil engineering. He had also assigned us a a final 
project for the semester. For the assingment each group is given
100 peices of raw spaghetti. You are allowed to use all 100
pieces however you want but you can only use 20 for the final 
bridge. The bridge is supposed to be strong enough to withstand 
a bucket filled with water. We are given 3 given to test and have
a final bridge ready at the end. 

This week we were making slime with our partner. We used water and
starch. We first mixed the water and starch together to get a thick
base. We then had the option to use food coloring which me and my 
patrtner decided to use. We used red food coloring and when we 
mixed it with the base we got a pink piece of slime. We then mixed
it some more and got our slime. This was a very easy process but 
the only problem we had was making a mess while mixing it other
than that it was a very fun and easy process.

Feburary 10th, We had a challenge day just like any other thursday.
Our objective was to create a device that would allow us to safely 
transport a water balloon across the field as fast as possible. Our
strategy was to line up the sticks and wrap the rubber bands around
them diagnoly. Then we just taped the whole thing to the ruler
and the device was complete. Our device was a success and unlike
other groups our water balloon didn't fall off once. </p>
